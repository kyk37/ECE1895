Button press for 1 or 3 leds
--> Using manual button debounce instead of a library like ezButton
an odd number of button presses will activate an LED to blink so long as it's held in
an even amount of button presses will activate 3 leds and they will blink once.
both functions will repeat so long as the button is held in.

Whisk together eggs, cinnamon milk and butter; then gradually whisk in milk.
Dredge each piece of bread through this egg mixture (do this right before placing it on the griddle! If you dredge your bread and then leave it to sit on a plate before cooking it, it tends to come out soggy).
Cook the dredged bread on a griddle or in a large nonstick skillet in melted butter, until golden brown on either side and nicely puffed up.
Serve immediately, or keep warm in a single layer on a rack in the oven at 125Â°F until all of the French toast slices have been cooked.  --Devin J
